abstract = {Agriculture production highly depends on water and soil factors which increasingly need to be utilized efficiently. Precision agriculture, through the set of information technologies that it uses, allows to effectively manage these resources. This work aims to gather the existing knowledge on technologies used in precision agriculture and ways to discern the most appropriate one for different contexts in agricultural processes. A systematic literature review is performed to identify precision agriculture implementations and to answer questions such as the type of technologies used, criteria for their comparison and selection, and the existence of frameworks that help to decide what technologies to implement. A total of 3,949 publications were reviewed, of which 259 addressed the posed research questions. The findings are that remote sensors are the most used technology, the required knowledge is an important criterion for deciding to implement precision agriculture, and no framework was found that guides its implementation.}

ABSTRACT = {Plant diseases cause economic losses and health risks, such as aflatoxins linked to liver cancer. These toxins, produced by fungi like Aspergillus flavus in figs, are often detected late through invasive methods or visual inspection. Since Spain, particularly Extremadura, is a key fig producer, alternative detection methods are essential to preventing aflatoxins in the food chain. The aim of this research is the early detection of Aspergillus flavus fungus using non-invasive techniques with hyperspectral imaging and applying artificial intelligence techniques, in particular deep learning. The images were taken after inoculation of the microtoxin using 3 different concentrations, related to three different classes and healthy figs (healthy controls). The analysis of the hyperspectral images was performed at the pixel level. Firstly, a fully connected neural network was used to analyze the spectral signature associated with each pixel; secondly, the wavelet transform was applied to each spectral signature. The resulting images were fed to a convolutional neural network. The hyperparameters of the proposed models were adjusted based on the parameter tuning process that was performed. The results are promising, with 83% accuracy, 82.75% recall, and 83.25% F1-measure for the fully connected neural network. The high F1-measure demonstrates that the model's performance is good. The model has a low incidence of false positives for samples that contain aflatoxin, while a higher number of false positives appears in healthy controls. Due to the presence of false negatives, this class also has a high recall. The convolutional neural network results, accuracy, recall, and F1 are 77.25%, indicating moderate model performance. Only class 3, with higher aflatoxin concentration, achieves high precision and low false positive incidence. Healthy controls exhibit a high presence of false negatives. In conclusion, we demonstrate the effectiveness of pixel-level analysis in identifying the presence of the fungus and the viability of the non-invasive techniques applied in improving food safety. Although further research is needed, in this study, the fully connected neural network model shows good performance with lower energy consumption.},

abstract = {The globe's population is increasing day by day, which causes the severe problem of organic food for everyone. Farmers are becoming progressively conscious of the need to control numerous essential factors such as crop health, water or fertilizer use, and harmful diseases in the field. However, it is challenging to monitor agricultural activities. Therefore, precision agriculture is an important decision support system for food production and decision-making. Several methods and approaches have been used to support precision agricultural practices. The present study performs a systematic literature review on hyperspectral imaging technology and the most advanced deep learning and machine learning algorithm used in agriculture applications to extract and synthesize the significant datasets and algorithms. We reviewed legal studies carefully, highlighted hyperspectral datasets, focused on the most methods used for hyperspectral applications in agricultural sectors, and gained insight into the critical problems and challenges in the hyperspectral data processing. According to our study, it has been found that the Hyperion hyperspectral, Landsat-8, and Sentinel 2 multispectral datasets were mainly used for agricultural applications. The most applied machine learning method was support vector machine and random forest. In addition, the deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) model is mainly used for crop classification due to its high performance with hyperspectral datasets. The present review will be helpful to the new researchers working in the field of hyperspectral remote sensing for agricultural applications with a machine and deep learning methods.}

abstract = {Over the last two decades, research in hyperspectral imaging has been increasing and its use in horticulture is expected to be spreading in the coming years. The emerging techniques are currently gaining interest of the research community. However, there are still challenges to the applicability. In this review we demonstrate that hyperspectral imaging can be used as an effective tool for fruit, vegetables and mushrooms in assessing quality parameters related to well defined variables that can be analysed in the laboratory, as well as complex properties such as maturity, ripeness, detection of biotic defects, physiological disorders, mechanical damages, and sensory quality. Therefore, this paper starts by giving an overview of the quality concept of produce, measuring principles, theory and analysis of hyperspectral imaging systems. Then, emerging techniques to monitor and assess quality parameters, both pre- and postharvest, are described, as well as applications of these are reviewed and discussed. Afterwards, this review proceeds by illustrating the current and potential use of artificial intelligence and its subdomains, machine learning and deep learning, for hyperspectral imaging analysis in horticulture. Lastly, some challenges and considerations for future research are highlighted, including improvement of data availability, possible solutions for an improved integration of artificial intelligence and the transfer of knowledge from research parameters to parameters relevant for industrial stakeholders.}

abstract = {Advances in computing technology have fostered the development of new and powerful deep learning (DL) techniques, which have demonstrated promising results in a wide range of applications. Particularly, DL methods have been successfully used to classify remotely sensed data collected by Earth Observation (EO) instruments. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a hot topic in remote sensing data analysis due to the vast amount of information comprised by this kind of images, which allows for a better characterization and exploitation of the Earth surface by combining rich spectral and spatial information. However, HSI poses major challenges for supervised classification methods due to the high dimensionality of the data and the limited availability of training samples. These issues, together with the high intraclass variability (and interclass similarity) –often present in HSI data– may hamper the effectiveness of classifiers. In order to solve these limitations, several DL-based architectures have been recently developed, exhibiting great potential in HSI data interpretation. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current-state-of-the-art in DL for HSI classification, analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of the most widely used classifiers in the literature. For each discussed method, we provide quantitative results using several well-known and widely used HSI scenes, thus providing an exhaustive comparison of the discussed techniques. The paper concludes with some remarks and hints about future challenges in the application of DL techniques to HSI classification.

ABSTRACT = {Modern hyperspectral imaging systems produce huge datasets potentially conveying a great abundance of information; such a resource, however, poses many challenges in the analysis and interpretation of these data. Deep learning approaches certainly offer a great variety of opportunities for solving classical imaging tasks and also for approaching new stimulating problems in the spatial–spectral domain. This is fundamental in the driving sector of Remote Sensing where hyperspectral technology was born and has mostly developed, but it is perhaps even more true in the multitude of current and evolving application sectors that involve these imaging technologies. The present review develops on two fronts: on the one hand, it is aimed at domain professionals who want to have an updated overview on how hyperspectral acquisition techniques can combine with deep learning architectures to solve specific tasks in different application fields. On the other hand, we want to target the machine learning and computer vision experts by giving them a picture of how deep learning technologies are applied to hyperspectral data from a multidisciplinary perspective. The presence of these two viewpoints and the inclusion of application fields other than Remote Sensing are the original contributions of this review, which also highlights some potentialities and critical issues related to the observed development trends.},

abstract = {In this paper, convolutional neural network models were developed to perform plant disease detection and diagnosis using simple leaves images of healthy and diseased plants, through deep learning methodologies. Training of the models was performed with the use of an open database of 87,848 images, containing 25 different plants in a set of 58 distinct classes of [plant, disease] combinations, including healthy plants. Several model architectures were trained, with the best performance reaching a 99.53% success rate in identifying the corresponding [plant, disease] combination (or healthy plant). The significantly high success rate makes the model a very useful advisory or early warning tool, and an approach that could be further expanded to support an integrated plant disease identification system to operate in real cultivation conditions.}

abstract = {Hyperspectral dimensionality reduction (HDR), an important preprocessing step prior to high-level data analysis, has been garnering growing attention in the remote sensing community. Although a variety of methods, both unsupervised and supervised models, have been proposed for this task, yet the discriminative ability in feature representation still remains limited due to the lack of a powerful tool that effectively exploits the labeled and unlabeled data in the HDR process. A semi-supervised HDR approach, called iterative multitask regression (IMR), is proposed in this paper to address this need. IMR aims at learning a low-dimensional subspace by jointly considering the labeled and unlabeled data, and also bridging the learned subspace with two regression tasks: labels and pseudo-labels initialized by a given classifier. More significantly, IMR dynamically propagates the labels on a learnable graph and progressively refines pseudo-labels, yielding a well-conditioned feedback system. Experiments conducted on three widely-used hyperspectral image datasets demonstrate that the dimension-reduced features learned by the proposed IMR framework with respect to classification or recognition accuracy are superior to those of related state-of-the-art HDR approaches.}
